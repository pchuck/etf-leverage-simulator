The [etf-leverage-simulator](https://pchuck.shinyapps.io/etf-leverage-simulator) synthesizes long-term leveraged ETF returns.

Leveraged ETF's are exchanged traded funds that use derivatives
and debt to magnify the returns of an underlying index. Such funds
apply a leverage multiplier (typical 2x or 3x) to amplify an index's
actual returns on a daily basis.

This application allows the user to select an underlying index
and then run a simulation to see how an ETF (applying daily leverage
to the underlying index) would have performed over the same period. 

First, use **Underlying Index** to load actual market returns for a specified
index or security.

 1. Enter a [symbol](http://finance.yahoo.com/lookup) for a
    market index or security.
 2. Select a date range via Start/End Date
 3. Click ***Fetch Data*** to retrieve the actual daily closing prices for
    the specified security

Then, adjust the **ETF Parameters** to run simulations.

 1. The ***Leverage Multiplier*** changes the multiplication factor applied
    to daily returns.
 2. The ***Expense Ratio*** changes the yearly expense overhead of the
    simulated ETF.
